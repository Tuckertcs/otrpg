# Open Table RPG / Rule Forge

## Rule Forge To-Do

* Dotted line lists (`Page.....#`).
* Images.
* Quotes.
* Dropdowns.
* Checkboxes (may be in lists, headers, paragraphs, etc.).
* Breaks (`<br>`).
* Underlined paragraphs (for writing in).
* More colors than red.
* `<blockquote>` and `<cite>`.
* `<figure>` and/or `<figcaption>` for putting captions on tables and stuff?
* `<sup>` and `<sub>` for superscript and subscript.
* `<var>` or `<math>` (I think?) for equations.
* `<table>` `<caption>` and `<tfoot>` for table captions and footers.
